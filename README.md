## 🧭 About Me

I spent over a decade at sea — not just navigating the ocean, but keeping the complex systems that power it alive. My foundation was built in the **Armed Forces**, where I learned precision under pressure. I took that discipline into the maritime world as an **Electrical, Electronics & Automation Specialist**, managing the electrical heartbeat of ships and fleets.

I've moved from the **engine room to the boardroom**, sitting in decision-making roles where fleet strategies are shaped and compliance frameworks are debated. I've seen the industry from all angles — the technical granularity of a circuit failure, the operational stress of the crew, and the strategic oversight of fleet management.

**Today, I'm translating all of that into code.**

I founded **[MarineGPT](https://marinegpt.in)** to build the intelligence layer that modern maritime operations lack — and I'm building AI tools that bring practical intelligence to everyone.

## 🔥 What I Believe

- **AI should be System-Aware** — Respecting the logic and constraints of real-world hardware
- **AI should be Compliant** — Embedding regulatory frameworks directly into decision support
- **AI should be Resilient** — Engineered with the same redundancy I demanded from shipboard systems
- **AI should be for Everybody** — Not just tech companies, but engineers, sailors, students, and everyday people
